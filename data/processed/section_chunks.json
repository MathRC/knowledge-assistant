        "text": "Introduction\nThis style guide is intended primarily for English-language authors and translators, both  in-house and freelance, working for the European Commission. But now that so many  texts in and around the EU institutions are drafted in English by native and non-native  speakers alike, its rules, reminders and handy references aim to serve a wider readership  as well.\nIn this guide, ‘style’ is synonymous with a set of accepted linguistic conventions; it  therefore refers to recommended in-house usage, not to literary style. Excellent advice  on how to improve writing style is given in  The Plain English Guide  by Martin Cutts  (Oxford University Press, 1999) and  Style: Toward Clarity and Grace  by Joseph M.  Williams (University of Chicago Press, 1995), and the European Commission’s own  How to write clearly , all of which encourage the use of good plain English. See also  Clear English – Tips for Translators ,  Tips on translating from Slovak into English  and  Misused English words and expressions in EU publications .\nFor reasons of stylistic consistency, the variety of English on which this guide bases its  instructions and advice is the shared standard usage of Ireland and the United Kingdom  (called ‘Irish/British usage’ or ‘Irish/British English’ in this guide).\nThe Guide is divided into two clearly distinct parts, the first dealing with linguistic  conventions applicable in all contexts and the second with the workings of the European  Union – and with how those workings are expressed and reflected in English. This  should not be taken to imply that ‘EU English’ is different from ‘real English’; it is  simply a reflection of the fact that the European Union as a unique body has had to  invent a terminology to describe itself. However, the overriding aim in both parts of the  Guide is to facilitate and encourage the writing of clear and reader-friendly English.\nWriting in clear language can be difficult at the Commission, since much of the subject  matter is complex and more and more is written in English by (and for) non-native  speakers, or by native speakers who are beginning to lose touch with their language  after years of working in a multilingual environment. We must nevertheless try to set an  example by using language that is as clear, simple and accessible as possible, out of  courtesy to our readers and consideration for the image of the Commission.",

        "text": "In legislative texts, accuracy and clarity are of course paramount. But legal or  bureaucratic language that we might regard as pompous elsewhere has its place in both  legislation and preparatory drafting, though the specialist terms must be embedded in  rock-solid, straightforward English syntax. In some cases – departmental memos or  papers for specialist committees – we may regard ‘Eurospeak’ as acceptable  professional shorthand; searching here for ‘plain English’ periphrases wastes time and  simply irritates readers.\nBy contrast, in-house jargon is not appropriate in documents addressing the general  public, such as leaflets or web pages. Information of practical use, e.g. on rights,  applying for jobs or accessing funding, must be immediately understandable even to  those unfamiliar with the workings and vocabulary of the EU. This also means, for\n  example, using short paragraphs, simple syntax and highlighting devices such as bullets.  For more information on writing web pages in particular, see the ‘ Web writing  guidelines ’ section of the Commission’s  Europa Web Guide .\nSo ‘style’ is a matter of everyday concern to both authors and translators, for whom we  hope this guide will be a practical source of information and an aid to consistency. We  have tried to bring together much that is available disparately in publications such as the  Interinstitutional Style Guide  published by the EU Publications Office, the  interinstitutional  Joint Practical Guide  for the drafting of EU legislation, the  Joint  Handbook  for the ordinary legislative procedure, and internal drafting tools such as the  Commission’s  Drafters’ Assistance Package . Needless to say, our Guide does not in  any way aim to replace these resources, which are well worth consulting in their own  right. Commission staff should also follow the  Commission Style Guide  published  internally by the Secretariat-General.\nMany others have contributed their time and expertise over the years, and even though  they remain nameless here, they are not forgotten.\nWhile we have done our best to ensure that the information set out in this guide is  relevant, correct and up to date, errors and omissions are inevitable. If you have any  comments on the content of the Guide, please send them by email to  DGT-EN- STYLE@ec.europa.eu .",

        "text": "2.14.   Commas in relative clauses.  Commas are used to make an important distinction  between two types of relative construction, often known as ‘defining’ and  ‘non-defining’ relative clauses. Compare the following sentences:\nThe auditors were not able to count the cows which were on the mountain  pasture at the time of the audit.\nThe auditors were not able to count the cows, which were on the mountain  pasture at the time of the audit.\nIn the first example – without a comma – the relative clause (which were on  the mountain …) tells us which cows we are talking about. This is called a  defining relative clause. The auditors were presumably able to count other  cows (the ones at the farm); it was just the ones on the mountain that couldn’t  be counted.\nIn the second example – with a comma – the relative clause is non-defining. It  merely adds extra information about the cows, but does not identify which ones  are being talked about. In this case, the auditors were not able to count any  cows at all, because they were all on the mountain.\nRelative clauses are also used parenthetically. Compare the following:\nMy uncle, who lives in America, is rich.\nMy uncle who lives in America is rich; my uncle who lives in Cuba is poor.\nIn the first example, I have only one uncle (he lives in America, by the way)  and he is rich. In the second, I have more than one uncle, and the one in  America is rich, while the one in Cuba is poor; we know which uncle is being  referred to in each case because he is defined by the relative clause.\nNote that the relative pronoun ‘that’ can be used (instead of ‘which’ or ‘who’)  in defining relative clauses, but not in non-defining relative clauses. Therefore  we can have:\nThe auditors were not able to count the cows  that  were on the mountain pasture  at the time of the audit.\nbut not:\nThe auditors were not able to count the cows , that  were on the mountain pasture  at the time of the audit.",

In that case they can be left  untranslated. If the term in question is unusual or likely to be unfamiliar to the  reader, you may place it in quotation marks or use a phrase such as ‘what is  known as’:\nThe resulting waste or ‘tailings’ often contaminate the groundwater.\nThe resulting waste, known as tailings, is often a source of water contamination.",

There is a tendency for compounds to develop  into single words when they come to be used more frequently:  data base,  data-base, database . As a general rule, the form used on the  Oxford  Dictionaries Premium website  or on the  Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website   should be followed (e.g.  end user ,  by-product ,  database ,  e-learning ).\nUse hyphens sparingly but to good purpose: in the phrase  crude oil production  statistics  a hyphen ( crude-oil ) can tell the reader that ‘crude’ applies to the oil  rather than the statistics. Failure to insert a hyphen when it is necessary could  lead to confusion or even change the meaning of the sentence:\na little-used car / a little used car\ngovernment-monitoring programme / government monitoring programme\nHyphens need not be inserted, however, if the meaning is clear and  unambiguous without them:\ncivil rights movement\nmechanical engineering degree\nAvoid using long strings of modifiers (adjectives and/or nouns qualifying other  nouns), as they can be confusing. Where the confusion cannot be resolved by  the addition of a hyphen, consider using prepositions to clarify the relationship  between the words:\nunderground mine worker safety procedures development\ndevelopment of safety procedures for underground mine workers\nSometimes hyphens are absolutely necessary to clarify the sense:\nre-cover – recover; re-creation – recreation; re-form – reform;    re-count – recount\nThe following are examples of well-used hyphens:\nuser-friendly software;    product-by-product input-output tables;    a two-day meeting; a four-month stay ( but  four months’ holiday);    45 tonne-kilometres; 15 person-days;    non-English-speaking population groups; non-EU-related business;    one-size-fits-all approach; buy-one-get-one-free offer",

When deciding whether to capitalise or not, it is useful to draw a  distinction between:\n♦   writing out official titles in full; and\n♦   using a short form.\nUsing a short form of the official title can make a text more readable by not  spelling out the full title every time it appears in the text. Authors often use this  device quite naturally and without thinking, but often capitalise the short form  unnecessarily. This is particularly common when authors refer back to the  names of EU and national strategies, programmes, action plans, etc., which  often have their origin in the title of a published document. Do not use initial  capitals when referring back to titles or documents in this way (even if the form  you are using is not much shorter than the original title):\nThe evaluation guidelines\nSlovakia’s 2013–2020 social protection programme\nthe 2020 action plan implementing the 2013-2022 medicines strategy\nFor further examples of short forms see  4.5  and  4.6  above.\nThe degree of formality of a text can also influence the choice of upper or  lower case. You can write  the Latvian government ,  the Spanish environment  ministry ,  the German and Swedish agriculture ministers , etc., except:  \n♦   when using (a translation of) the full formal title (see  5.10 );\n♦   in the expression ‘Heads of State or Government’ (see  4.16 );\n♦   in diplomatic correspondence (see  Annex 7 ).\nThe use of lower case in short forms should not introduce ambiguity. For  example, an initial capital may be needed to avoid confusion between  the  Funds  in reference to specific EU funds like the European Social Fund and  the  funds  as amounts of money in a more general sense.",

When referring to the countries of the Nordic Council,  i.e. Denmark (including the Faeroes and Greenland), Finland (including  Åland), Iceland, Norway and Sweden, use ‘Nordic’ rather than ‘Scandinavian’  in terms such as ‘Nordic countries’ or ‘Nordic cooperation’.\nHowever, you may use ‘Scandinavia(n)’ if you do not need to be specific,  though bear in mind the following points. In its narrow geographical  interpretation, ‘Scandinavia’ refers to the two countries of the Scandinavian  peninsula, i.e. Norway and Sweden. In practice, however, it includes Denmark  and is often stretched to cover Finland. As a cultural term, ‘Scandinavian’ also  embraces Iceland and the Faeroes. Note that ‘Scandinavian languages’ refers to  the northern Germanic languages, i.e. Danish, Faeroese, Icelandic, Norwegian,  and Swedish, but not of course Finnish.",

For EU publications, the punctuation should  be adapted according to the rules set out in the  Interinstitutional Style Guide :  see ‘ Subdivision of acts ’ (for legal acts) and ‘ Divisions of the text ’ (for general  publications). For example, ‘point a)’ in French becomes ‘point (a)’ in English.  When translating other documents, you may make the same adaptations or  follow the conventions of the original, as long as you are consistent.\nIn texts written in other alphabets, upper- and lower-case letters used as serial  numbers should be replaced in the translation by the equivalent upper- and  lower-case Latin serial numbers. Note, however, that numbering conventions  vary from language to language and place to place.\nIn EU texts, where the lower-case letters from a to z are used for the first 26  points, the next 26 points are labelled from aa to zz, then aaa to zzz and so on.\nBulgarian likewise uses the first 26 letters of its alphabet, from а to щ,  followed by аа to щщ, then ааа to щщщ and so on. The last four letters of the  alphabet (ъ, ь, ю, я) are ignored.\nGreek, however, uses a decimal system.\n♦   α), β), γ), δ), ε), στ), ζ), η), θ) represent units (from 1 to 9), translated as (a)\nto (i)",

So when an\n  abbreviation that may not be familiar to readers first occurs, it is best to write  out the full term followed by the abbreviation in brackets:\nThe emissions trading scheme (ETS) should enable the EU to meet its Kyoto  target.\nIf your document contains a lot of abbreviations, consider including a list of  them and their meanings at the beginning or end of the document.\nSecond, they should not be used needlessly. If an abbreviation occurs only  once or twice, it is best to dispense with it altogether and use the full form. In  repeated references, it is also often possible to use a short form instead of an  abbreviation:\nThe emissions trading scheme is now in operation throughout the EU … The  scheme will involve constant monitoring of emissions trading activities.\nLastly, an abbreviation in an original for translation should not be rendered by  an improvised one in English (e.g. repeated references to ‘VM’ in an Estonian  text should be spelled out as ‘the Foreign Ministry’ or just ‘the Ministry’ rather  than ‘FM’ or a similar coined abbreviation).

Further, no point is used after the  v  in the  names of court cases ( Smith  v  Jones ) and sporting contests. The abbreviation  No  for ‘number’ (plural  Nos ) also has no final point, as it is in fact a  contraction  of the Latin  numero .\n  As in the case of  e.g.  and  i.e. , some common truncations are traditionally never  written in upper case – even at the beginning of a footnote ( c. [=circa], p., pp.,  l., ll. [= line/s] ).\nNote that first names should be abbreviated with a single letter only, followed  by a point  (Philippe:   P .,  Theodor:   T . , Ádám: Á., Łukasz: Ł. ). Multiple initials  should normally be written with points and separated by a hard space 1  ( J. S.  Bach ). For compound first names, use both initials ( Jean-Marie: J.-M. ). See,  however,  5.1 .\nSome Latin alphabets contain letter combinations (digraphs) which count as  distinct letters: note that György is therefore abbreviated to Gy. and Zsuzsanna  to Zs.\nFor Slavonic languages that use a Cyrillic alphabet, initials should be  transliterated as shown in  Annex 4 .

The Council adopts its position on the draft and  forwards it to the Parliament, and if they both approve it, the draft is adopted.  In the event of disagreement, a conciliation procedure comes into play.\nEach EU institution has its own section of the budget, divided into revenue and  expenditure and then into titles, chapters, articles and items ( budget lines ). The  Commission section is by far the largest. Expenditure is broken down by policy  area (titles) and activity (chapters). This budget management approach is  known as activity-based budgeting (ABB).",

If not,  the approach adopted will depend on how the title is structured in the source  language.\nA title containing a number and a date should be translated for information  purposes: the number and date make it easily identifiable.\nNos termos do artigo 7.° da Lei n.° 6, de 25 de agosto, que regula o  acompanhamento, apreciação e pronúncia pela Assembleia da República no  âmbito do processo de construção da União Europeia…\nPursuant to Article 7 of Law No 6 of 25 August 2006 on the monitoring,  examination and issuing of opinions by the Assembly of the Portuguese Republic  in the context of the process of EU integration…\nIf the act is mentioned again in the document, the number and date (in this  case, Law No 6 of 25 August 2006) is usually sufficient.\nWhere the national legal system provides an official abbreviation of the title,  this should always be used, along with a translation/gloss of the title for  information purposes:\nZakon o Slovenskem filmskem centru javni agenciji Republike Slovenije ZSFCJA\nSlovenian Film Centre Act (ZSFCJA)\nIf the act is mentioned again in the document, the abbreviation is usually  sufficient.\nWhere no number, date or official abbreviation is provided, the translated title  should be followed by the original title in brackets. Various approaches to  translating titles are set out below.\nIn common law systems (such as those of England and Wales, Northern  Ireland, Ireland, the United States, Australia and India), titles of legislative acts  customarily appear in a form which is concise, avoids the use of relative  clauses, contains few prepositions, and – with the exception of brackets – is  largely devoid of punctuation.\nExamples:\nPolice (Complaints and Conduct) Act 2012\n  The European Parliamentary Elections (Returning Officers’ and Local  Returning Officers’ Charges) (Great Britain and Gibraltar) Order 2014",

Their structure is in some cases governed by rules prescribing the use of  specific phrases, prepositions, punctuation, etc.\nExamples:\nLoi modifiant la loi relative à la protection des animaux\nRozporządzenie Ministra Finansów z dnia 24 czerwca 2011 r. zmieniające  rozporządzenie w sprawie kryteriów i warunków technicznych, którym muszą  odpowiadać kasy rejestrujące oraz warunków ich stosowania\nThese descriptive titles can often be neatly translated into English by inverting  the word order so that they appear in the more concise form customary in  common law countries.\nExamples (from French, but equally applicable to many languages):\nLoi concernant les chèques , Cheques Act\nLoi no. 66-537 du 24 juillet 1966 sur les sociétés commerciales , Commercial  Business Associations Act No 66-537 of 24 July 1966\nLoi abrogeant l’article 77 du Code civil , Civil Code (Article 77) Repeal Act\nLoi modifiant la loi relative à la protection des animaux , Protection of Animals  (Amendment) Act\nAlternatively, and in particular if this procedure becomes unmanageable or if  you feel the reader might be confused, it may be preferable to follow the  structure of the original language:\nExample:\nLoi abrogeant l’article 77 du Code civil , Act repealing Article 77 of the Civil  Code\nTo avoid a top-heavy or bottom-heavy title it may sometimes be possible to  combine these styles, as in the title of this piece of US legislation:  1997  Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from Natural  Disasters, and for Overseas Peacekeeping Efforts, Including Those in Bosnia .",

As a result,  there is considerable variety and inconsistency encountered in practice: for example, the  Belarusian city of Магілёў is variously transliterated as Mahiloŭ, Mahilyow, Mahilëŭ,  Mahili ͡  oŭ, Mahilëw, Magìlëǔ, Mahilioú and Mahilioŭ, and while one Ukrainian Юлия  may transliterate herself Yulia, another will use Yuliya, another Yuliia and yet another  Iuliia.\nThe systems recommended here are based on official systems in use in the respective  countries. As the systems are language-specific, care should be taken to use the right  transliteration system for the right language: for example, a Russian ‘Ольга’ is ‘Olga’,  but a Ukrainian one is ‘Olha’.\nIf not available on the keyboard you are using, accented letters such as đ, ž and ŭ can be  found by using the Insert Symbol menu in Word.\nWhile these transliteration rules can be reliably applied in most cases, it may sometimes  be appropriate to deviate from them, for example:\n♦   where there is a more familiar established spelling: ‘София’ > ‘Sofia’ (not\n‘Sofiya’), ‘България’ > ‘Bulgaria’ (not ‘Balgariya’), ‘Чайкoвский’ >  ‘Tchaikovsky’ (not ‘Chaykovski’);\n♦   where an individual habitually uses a different spelling: e.g. the Bulgarian\npolitician ‘Иван Станчoв’ himself uses the spelling ‘Ivan Stancioff’ rather  than ‘Ivan Stanchov’;\n♦   for foreign names from languages not written in Cyrillic, in which case",

Notes:  A letter starting with ‘(Dear) Sir/Madam/Excellency etc.’ should finish with ‘yours  faithfully’.  A letter starting with ‘Dear’ and including the name of the recipient should finish with  ‘yours sincerely’.  In private correspondence, it is usual to address your addressee by name. In  administrative correspondence, however, it is preferable to address your addressee with  their title, if they have one – for example, as president of an organisation or association  – rather than by their name, as you are addressing them as holder of that office or  function, and not in a personal capacity. For example, a letter addressed to Ms Margaret  Smith, President of the Locksmiths Association, would start ‘Dear President’ and not  ‘Dear Ms Smith’ and a letter addressed to a member of the judiciary should start with  ‘Dear Judge’ or, if applicable, a more specific title (e.g. ‘Dear President’ or ‘Dear Chief  Justice’).",
