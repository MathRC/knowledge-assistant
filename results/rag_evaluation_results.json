But legal or  bureaucratic language that we might regard as pompous elsewhere has its place in both  legislation and preparatory drafting, though the specialist terms must be embedded in  rock-solid, straightforward English syntax. In some cases – departmental memos or  papers for specialist committees – we may regard ‘Eurospeak’ as acceptable  professional shorthand; searching here for ‘plain English’ periphrases wastes time and  simply irritates readers.\nBy contrast, in-house jargon is not appropriate in documents addressing the general  public, such as leaflets or web pages. Information of practical use, e.g. on rights,  applying for jobs or accessing funding, must be immediately understandable even to  those unfamiliar with the workings and vocabulary of the EU. This also means, for\n  example, using short paragraphs, simple syntax and highlighting devices such as bullets.

        "answer": "Based on the context provided, the EU style guide differs from the Chicago Manual of Style in how it capitalizes government bodies and titles in the following ways:\n\n1. It capitalizes all nouns and adjectives when writing out the full titles of organizations, institutions, directorates, units, sections, office holders, committees, delegations, etc. For example: \"Publications and Dissemination Directorate\", \"Business Development and Support Unit\".\n\n2. For long descriptive names that read more like a description than a formal title, it recommends capitalizing only the head word and using lowercase for the rest. For example: \"Committee for the adaptation to technical progress of the Directive on the introduction of recording equipment in road transport\".\n\n3. When using shortened forms or referring back to the names of strategies, programs, action plans etc., it recommends using lowercase, even if the shortened form is not much shorter than the original title.\n\n4. It makes exceptions and uses capitals for references to permanent EU bodies/formations like \"College of Commissioners\", \"Directorates-General\" and official functions like \"Members of the Commission\", even in the plural form.\n\nThe Chicago Manual of Style has some different capitalization rules, but the EU style guide does not explicitly compare or contrast its approach with other major style guides in the context provided. The focus is on establishing clear internal conventions for capitalizing various EU governmental bodies, programs and titles.",

We must nevertheless try to set an  example by using language that is as clear, simple and accessible as possible, out of  courtesy to our readers and consideration for the image of the Commission.\n\n---\n\n4.5.   Titles of organisations, institutions, directorates, units, sections, office holders,  committees, delegations, etc.  Use initial capitals on all nouns and adjectives  when writing out titles in full:\nPublications and Dissemination Directorate\nBusiness Development and Support Unit\nEditorial Partnerships Section\nFuture Policies Working Group\nPresident of the Council\nDirector-General for Agriculture\nCouncil of Europe\nEuropean Development Fund\nMarkets in Crop Products Directorate\nPresident of the French Republic\nVice-Chair of the Committee on International Relations (but referring back, you  should write ‘the vice-chair noted that …’)\nUse capitals for a particular institution or person, but small letters for groups of  institutions  or  people.  Exception:  references  to  permanent  EU  bodies/formations (e.g. ‘College of Commissioners’, ‘Directorates-General’,  ‘Cabinets’) and to official functions within the EU institutions (e.g. ‘Members  of the Commission’, ‘Directors-General’) always take a capital letter, whether  in the singular or the plural.\n  Ad hoc groups (e.g. the Polish delegation to a meeting) do not require initial  capitals.\nFor long names that read more like a description than a real title use an initial  capital for the head word and lower case for the rest:\nCommittee for the adaptation to technical progress of the Directive on the  introduction of recording equipment in road transport (tachograph)\nJoint FAO/EC working party on forest and forest product statistics\nNames of institutions reproduced in a foreign language should retain the  capitalisation of the original language, e.g.  Banque centrale du Luxembourg . If  you translate the name directly then English capitalisation rules apply, e.g.  Central Bank of Luxembourg . Use initial capitals for official or literal  translations but lower case for descriptive translations:\nThe Federal Constitutional Court is the German supreme court.\n\n---\n\n4.7.   Short forms . When deciding whether to capitalise or not, it is useful to draw a  distinction between:\n♦   writing out official titles in full; and\n♦   using a short form.\nUsing a short form of the official title can make a text more readable by not  spelling out the full title every time it appears in the text. Authors often use this  device quite naturally and without thinking, but often capitalise the short form  unnecessarily. This is particularly common when authors refer back to the  names of EU and national strategies, programmes, action plans, etc., which  often have their origin in the title of a published document. Do not use initial  capitals when referring back to titles or documents in this way (even if the form  you are using is not much shorter than the original title):\nThe evaluation guidelines\nSlovakia’s 2013–2020 social protection programme\nthe 2020 action plan implementing the 2013-2022 medicines strategy\nFor further examples of short forms see  4.5  and  4.6  above.\nThe degree of formality of a text can also influence the choice of upper or  lower case. You can write  the Latvian government ,  the Spanish environment  ministry ,  the German and Swedish agriculture ministers , etc., except:  \n♦   when using (a translation of) the full formal title (see  5.10 );\n♦   in the expression ‘Heads of State or Government’ (see  4.16 );\n♦   in diplomatic correspondence (see  Annex 7 ).\nThe use of lower case in short forms should not introduce ambiguity. For  example, an initial capital may be needed to avoid confusion between  the  Funds  in reference to specific EU funds like the European Social Fund and  the  funds  as amounts of money in a more general sense.\n\n---\n\nIn legislative texts, accuracy and clarity are of course paramount. But legal or  bureaucratic language that we might regard as pompous elsewhere has its place in both  legislation and preparatory drafting, though the specialist terms must be embedded in  rock-solid, straightforward English syntax. In some cases – departmental memos or  papers for specialist committees – we may regard ‘Eurospeak’ as acceptable  professional shorthand; searching here for ‘plain English’ periphrases wastes time and  simply irritates readers.\nBy contrast, in-house jargon is not appropriate in documents addressing the general  public, such as leaflets or web pages.

We  have tried to bring together much that is available disparately in publications such as the  Interinstitutional Style Guide  published by the EU Publications Office, the  interinstitutional  Joint Practical Guide  for the drafting of EU legislation, the  Joint  Handbook  for the ordinary legislative procedure, and internal drafting tools such as the  Commission’s  Drafters’ Assistance Package .

When deciding whether to capitalise or not, it is useful to draw a  distinction between:\n♦   writing out official titles in full; and\n♦   using a short form.\nUsing a short form of the official title can make a text more readable by not  spelling out the full title every time it appears in the text. Authors often use this  device quite naturally and without thinking, but often capitalise the short form  unnecessarily. This is particularly common when authors refer back to the  names of EU and national strategies, programmes, action plans, etc., which  often have their origin in the title of a published document. Do not use initial  capitals when referring back to titles or documents in this way (even if the form  you are using is not much shorter than the original title):\nThe evaluation guidelines\nSlovakia’s 2013–2020 social protection programme\nthe 2020 action plan implementing the 2013-2022 medicines strategy\nFor further examples of short forms see  4.5  and  4.6  above.\nThe degree of formality of a text can also influence the choice of upper or  lower case. You can write  the Latvian government ,  the Spanish environment  ministry ,  the German and Swedish agriculture ministers , etc., except:  \n♦   when using (a translation of) the full formal title (see  5.10 );\n♦   in the expression ‘Heads of State or Government’ (see  4.16 );\n♦   in diplomatic correspondence (see  Annex 7 ).\nThe use of lower case in short forms should not introduce ambiguity. For  example, an initial capital may be needed to avoid confusion between  the  Funds  in reference to specific EU funds like the European Social Fund and  the  funds  as amounts of money in a more general sense.\n\n---\n\nIn legislative texts, accuracy and clarity are of course paramount. But legal or  bureaucratic language that we might regard as pompous elsewhere has its place in both  legislation and preparatory drafting, though the specialist terms must be embedded in  rock-solid, straightforward English syntax. In some cases – departmental memos or  papers for specialist committees – we may regard ‘Eurospeak’ as acceptable  professional shorthand; searching here for ‘plain English’ periphrases wastes time and  simply irritates readers.\nBy contrast, in-house jargon is not appropriate in documents addressing the general  public, such as leaflets or web pages. Information of practical use, e.g. on rights,  applying for jobs or accessing funding, must be immediately understandable even to  those unfamiliar with the workings and vocabulary of the EU. This also means, for\n  example, using short paragraphs, simple syntax and highlighting devices such as bullets.  For more information on writing web pages in particular, see the ‘ Web writing  guidelines ’ section of the Commission’s  Europa Web Guide .\nSo ‘style’ is a matter of everyday concern to both authors and translators, for whom we  hope this guide will be a practical source of information and an aid to consistency. We  have tried to bring together much that is available disparately in publications such as the  Interinstitutional Style Guide  published by the EU Publications Office, the  interinstitutional  Joint Practical Guide  for the drafting of EU legislation, the  Joint  Handbook  for the ordinary legislative procedure, and internal drafting tools such as the  Commission’s  Drafters’ Assistance Package .

Your translation must allow the act to be\nidentified easily and unambiguously. If the country’s legal system provides an  official English translation, it should always be used (see also  23.15 ). If not,  the approach adopted will depend on how the title is structured in the source  language.\nA title containing a number and a date should be translated for information  purposes: the number and date make it easily identifiable.\nNos termos do artigo 7.° da Lei n.° 6, de 25 de agosto, que regula o  acompanhamento, apreciação e pronúncia pela Assembleia da República no  âmbito do processo de construção da União Europeia…\nPursuant to Article 7 of Law No 6 of 25 August 2006 on the monitoring,  examination and issuing of opinions by the Assembly of the Portuguese Republic  in the context of the process of EU integration…\nIf the act is mentioned again in the document, the number and date (in this  case, Law No 6 of 25 August 2006) is usually sufficient.\nWhere the national legal system provides an official abbreviation of the title,  this should always be used, along with a translation/gloss of the title for  information purposes:\nZakon o Slovenskem filmskem centru javni agenciji Republike Slovenije ZSFCJA\nSlovenian Film Centre Act (ZSFCJA)\nIf the act is mentioned again in the document, the abbreviation is usually  sufficient.\nWhere no number, date or official abbreviation is provided, the translated title  should be followed by the original title in brackets. Various approaches to  translating titles are set out below.\nIn common law systems (such as those of England and Wales, Northern  Ireland, Ireland, the United States, Australia and India), titles of legislative acts  customarily appear in a form which is concise, avoids the use of relative  clauses, contains few prepositions, and – with the exception of brackets – is  largely devoid of punctuation.\nExamples:\nPolice (Complaints and Conduct) Act 2012\n  The European Parliamentary Elections (Returning Officers’ and Local  Returning Officers’ Charges) (Great Britain and Gibraltar) Order 2014\n\n---\n\n9.5.   Cyrillic.  When transliterating for EU documents, use the scheme set out in  Annex 4  –  Transliteration Table for Cyrillic . (Note that the ‘soft sign’ and  ‘hard sign’ should be omitted.) Remember that the EU languages have different  transliteration systems (DE:  Boschurischte, Tschernobyl;  FR:  Bojourichté,  Tchernobyl ; EN:  Bozhurishte, Chernobyl ). An internet search will normally  reveal whether there is a more commonly used English transliteration which is  acceptable for particular proper names.

Some people have taken to referring to events following the Brexit  referendum on 23 June 2016 as ‘since Brexit’ or ‘in the post-Brexit world’,  when what they mean is ‘since the Brexit referendum’. This is not only  inaccurate, it is also loaded with political connotations. The UK did not  actually leave the EU until 31 January 2020.\n\n---\n\nIntroduction\nThis style guide is intended primarily for English-language authors and translators, both  in-house and freelance, working for the European Commission. But now that so many  texts in and around the EU institutions are drafted in English by native and non-native  speakers alike, its rules, reminders and handy references aim to serve a wider readership  as well.\nIn this guide, ‘style’ is synonymous with a set of accepted linguistic conventions; it  therefore refers to recommended in-house usage, not to literary style. Excellent advice  on how to improve writing style is given in  The Plain English Guide  by Martin Cutts  (Oxford University Press, 1999) and  Style: Toward Clarity and Grace  by Joseph M.  Williams (University of Chicago Press, 1995), and the European Commission’s own  How to write clearly , all of which encourage the use of good plain English. See also  Clear English – Tips for Translators ,  Tips on translating from Slovak into English  and  Misused English words and expressions in EU publications .\nFor reasons of stylistic consistency, the variety of English on which this guide bases its  instructions and advice is the shared standard usage of Ireland and the United Kingdom  (called ‘Irish/British usage’ or ‘Irish/British English’ in this guide).\nThe Guide is divided into two clearly distinct parts, the first dealing with linguistic  conventions applicable in all contexts and the second with the workings of the European  Union – and with how those workings are expressed and reflected in English. This  should not be taken to imply that ‘EU English’ is different from ‘real English’; it is  simply a reflection of the fact that the European Union as a unique body has had to  invent a terminology to describe itself. However, the overriding aim in both parts of the  Guide is to facilitate and encourage the writing of clear and reader-friendly English.\nWriting in clear language can be difficult at the Commission, since much of the subject  matter is complex and more and more is written in English by (and for) non-native  speakers, or by native speakers who are beginning to lose touch with their language  after years of working in a multilingual environment. We must nevertheless try to set an  example by using language that is as clear, simple and accessible as possible, out of  courtesy to our readers and consideration for the image of the Commission.\n\n---\n\nIn legislative texts, accuracy and clarity are of course paramount. But legal or  bureaucratic language that we might regard as pompous elsewhere has its place in both  legislation and preparatory drafting, though the specialist terms must be embedded in  rock-solid, straightforward English syntax. In some cases – departmental memos or  papers for specialist committees – we may regard ‘Eurospeak’ as acceptable  professional shorthand; searching here for ‘plain English’ periphrases wastes time and  simply irritates readers.\nBy contrast, in-house jargon is not appropriate in documents addressing the general  public, such as leaflets or web pages. Information of practical use, e.g. on rights,  applying for jobs or accessing funding, must be immediately understandable even to  those unfamiliar with the workings and vocabulary of the EU. This also means, for\n  example, using short paragraphs, simple syntax and highlighting devices such as bullets.  For more information on writing web pages in particular, see the ‘ Web writing  guidelines ’ section of the Commission’s  Europa Web Guide .\nSo ‘style’ is a matter of everyday concern to both authors and translators, for whom we  hope this guide will be a practical source of information and an aid to consistency. We  have tried to bring together much that is available disparately in publications such as the  Interinstitutional Style Guide  published by the EU Publications Office, the  interinstitutional  Joint Practical Guide  for the drafting of EU legislation, the  Joint  Handbook  for the ordinary legislative procedure, and internal drafting tools such as the  Commission’s  Drafters’ Assistance Package . Needless to say, our Guide does not in  any way aim to replace these resources, which are well worth consulting in their own  right. Commission staff should also follow the  Commission Style Guide  published  internally by the Secretariat-General.\nMany others have contributed their time and expertise over the years, and even though  they remain nameless here, they are not forgotten.\nWhile we have done our best to ensure that the information set out in this guide is  relevant, correct and up to date, errors and omissions are inevitable. If you have any  comments on the content of the Guide, please send them by email to  DGT-EN- STYLE@ec.europa.eu .\n\n---\n\n23.17.   Translating the titles of legislation.  Your translation must allow the act to be\nidentified easily and unambiguously. If the country’s legal system provides an  official English translation, it should always be used (see also  23.15 ). If not,  the approach adopted will depend on how the title is structured in the source  language.\nA title containing a number and a date should be translated for information  purposes: the number and date make it easily identifiable.\nNos termos do artigo 7.° da Lei n.° 6, de 25 de agosto, que regula o  acompanhamento, apreciação e pronúncia pela Assembleia da República no  âmbito do processo de construção da União Europeia…\nPursuant to Article 7 of Law No 6 of 25 August 2006 on the monitoring,  examination and issuing of opinions by the Assembly of the Portuguese Republic  in the context of the process of EU integration…\nIf the act is mentioned again in the document, the number and date (in this  case, Law No 6 of 25 August 2006) is usually sufficient.\nWhere the national legal system provides an official abbreviation of the title,  this should always be used, along with a translation/gloss of the title for  information purposes:\nZakon o Slovenskem filmskem centru javni agenciji Republike Slovenije ZSFCJA\nSlovenian Film Centre Act (ZSFCJA)\nIf the act is mentioned again in the document, the abbreviation is usually  sufficient.\nWhere no number, date or official abbreviation is provided, the translated title  should be followed by the original title in brackets. Various approaches to  translating titles are set out below.\nIn common law systems (such as those of England and Wales, Northern  Ireland, Ireland, the United States, Australia and India), titles of legislative acts  customarily appear in a form which is concise, avoids the use of relative  clauses, contains few prepositions, and – with the exception of brackets – is  largely devoid of punctuation.\nExamples:\nPolice (Complaints and Conduct) Act 2012\n  The European Parliamentary Elections (Returning Officers’ and Local  Returning Officers’ Charges) (Great Britain and Gibraltar) Order 2014\n\n---\n\n9.5.   Cyrillic.  When transliterating for EU documents, use the scheme set out in  Annex 4  –  Transliteration Table for Cyrillic . (Note that the ‘soft sign’ and  ‘hard sign’ should be omitted.) Remember that the EU languages have different  transliteration systems (DE:  Boschurischte, Tschernobyl;  FR:  Bojourichté,  Tchernobyl ; EN:  Bozhurishte, Chernobyl ). An internet search will normally  reveal whether there is a more commonly used English transliteration which is  acceptable for particular proper names. For other languages, see e.g. the  Wikipedia entry on Cyrillic ."
